silly little project. making tinder like smth smth for programmers. 

highly unfinished. right now i have not even scratched the surface

## Goals 
- design would be very minimal (its a design choice not a skill issue)
- people can make accounts 
- people can friend other
- chatting is optional because of my backend skill issues.
